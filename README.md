**Data Analytics Projects**

Welcome to my repository containing data analytics projects! In this repository, you'll find a collection of projects where I've analyzed and visualized datasets to gain insights and solve problems.

**Projects Included**

Movie Recommendation System: Developed a movie recommender using Python, Pandas, and scikit-learn. Implemented TF-IDF for text vectorization, calculated cosine similarity, and created an interactive interface for user-friendly movie searches and recommendations.

Pizza-Pulse-Analyzing-Sales-Trends: I led an extensive examination of pizza sales data using Python, MySQL Server, and Power BI. This endeavor began by proficiently importing sizable CSV files into MySQL utilizing Python and Pandas. Subsequently, I undertook the tasks of data extraction, cleaning, and transformation from MySQL-based sales database. Through thorough analysis, I extracted valuable insights into our business performance and customer preferences.
